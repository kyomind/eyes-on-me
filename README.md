# ✨ Eyes on Me

**AI insight from your own words.**

> *"Did you ever know that I had mine on you?"*

## What is this?

**Eyes on Me** is an AI-powered self-reflection engine. It watches your daily memos, processes them with LLMs, and delivers daily, weekly, and monthly reports that offer a new perspective on your thoughts, actions, and habits.

Not just note-taking. Awareness.

## Prerequisite

To use this project, you must have your own [memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos) instance running.

This tool requires access to the `memos.sqlite` file generated by memos. You'll need to:

1. Self-host your memos instance and ensure it's actively logging your entries.
2. Locate the `memos.sqlite` database file.
3. Provide its path/configuration to `eyes-on-me` for analysis.

Without this, the system has nothing to reflect on.

## Key Features

* 🧠 LLM-based log analysis
* 📊 Daily / Weekly / Monthly digest generation
* 🔁 Automated scheduling via Celery + Redis + Flower + Beat
* 🗃️ Clean separation of original data (memos.sqlite) and analysis results (analysis.sqlite)
* ☁️ Optional cloud sync to Cloudflare D1 for easy web access

## Philosophy

This is not about writing notes.
It's about building an evolving, self-aware knowledge system that reflects you — with the help of a tireless AI.

Your logs speak. This tool listens.

## Tech Stack

* Python
* SQLite (memos.sqlite + analysis.sqlite)
* Celery + Redis + Flower + Beat (task orchestration)
* No ORM. Raw SQL only.
* CLI-first architecture
* Optional: Cloudflare D1 for dashboard sync
